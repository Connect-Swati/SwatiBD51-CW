setting up an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system in Node.js using Sequelize, which is one of the most popular ORM libraries for relational databases like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more.

Step 1: Installation & Setup
Step 1.a: Dependencies
We begin by installing necessary packages:

express: 
Facilitates web application development as a framework for Node.js.

sequelize: 
Serves as an ORM for Node.js, enabling data management via objects rather than SQL strings, supporting databases like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

sqlite3:
Provides a lightweight, serverless, disk-based database accessible through SQL.

Packages are installed using the command:

npm install express sequelize sqlite3 // or by adding dependencies directly from dependencies tab

Step 1.b: Creating a Sequelize Instance

Folder Organization:
We create a folder named lib and inside it, a file index.js. This structure helps separate configuration settings from business logic.

Sequelize Configuration:
In lib/index.js, we initialize a Sequelize instance configured for SQLite.
We also export DataTypes, needed for defining the schema in database models.

// /lib/index.js
let sq = require("sequelize"); /*Imports the sequelize package, which is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Node.js. It simplifies the management of database data by mapping database entries to JavaScript objects and vice versa
 */
let sequelize = new sq.Sequelize({
  dialect: "sqlite",
  storage: "./database.sqlite",
});

/*
Creates an instance of Sequelize configured to use a SQLite database.
dialect: "sqlite": Specifies the type of database being used. In this case, it's SQLite.
storage: "./database.sqlite": Defines the path to the SQLite database file. This tells Sequelize where to find or create the database file.
*/
module.exports = { DataTypes: sq.DataTypes, sequelize };
/*
Exports the sequelize instance and DataTypes object from this module.
DataTypes: A collection of data type definitions that Sequelize will use to define the model attributes. These correspond to the types of the columns in the database.
sequelize: The configured Sequelize instance, ready to be used elsewhere in the application to interact with the database.
*/




Step 2: Creating Models

Step 2.a: Models Folder
We create a folder named models and within it, a file track.model.js. Models in Sequelize represent tables in the database.

Step 2.b: Defining a Model

Model Import: We import the Sequelize instance and DataTypes from lib/index.js.
Model Definition: We define a model named Track with attributes that correspond to table columns.
const { sequelize, DataTypes } = require("../lib/index");


// Defines a model representing the 'Track' table with its structure
const Track = sequelize.define("Track", {
  name : DataTypes.TEXT, //// Defines a text column for the track name
  artist : DataTypes.TEXT,
  album : DataTypes.TEXT,
  genre : DataTypes.TEXT,
  duration : DataTypes.INTEGER,
  release_year : DataTypes.INTEGER,// Defines an integer column for the release year
});
// Makes the Track model available elsewhere in the application
module.exports = Track;

Step 3: Seeding the Database with Data
Step 3.a: Express Server Setup
An Express server is set up with a special endpoint /seed_db that is intended to populate the database with predefined data.

Step 3.b: Seeding Process

Using the Track Model: We use the Track model to insert data into the database using the bulkCreate method, which is effective for inserting large amounts of data efficiently.
